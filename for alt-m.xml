This is an XML file.

I don't use them at the moment, but you'll see them all over the internet.
They are popular with developers for storing data in a way that is easy to read by both computers and people.

Note that, just like JSON, there is also a root, which you can call anything.

Here is an example of an XML document. Below is a sample of some of the syntax.

You store data in tags, which look like this: <this_is_a_paired_tag>some data goes here.</this_is_a_paired_tag>, or like this:
<this_is_a_non-paired_tag />
You can put words, numbers or other tags inside a tag.

You'll often also come across a thing called parameters inside a tag. They look like this:
<person name="alt-m" project="Kettle3D" office_number="6" shirt_colour="black"></person>.
You put the name of the parameter here:    ^, and the value goes here:   ^ inside some quotes.

<root>
	<block type="concrete" x="5" y="90" z="87" colour="grey" />
	<texts>
		<text>Q: What goes here?</text>
		<text>A: Anything!</text>
		<text>   As long as you don't put a closing tag here, otherwise it won't do what you want it to.</text>
	</texts>
</root>
